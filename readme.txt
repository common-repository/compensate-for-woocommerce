Every purchase decision is a climate action.

== Description ==

*About Compensate*

**Who we are**
Compensate is a nonprofit on a mission to make every purchase decision a step towards carbon negativity. We calculate the climate impact of your customer’s order and shipment, and enable you to take action with your community.

**How to get started**

It takes just 5 minutes to install the Compensate app. We’ll walk you through the installation process, and with a few clicks and questions, you’ll be ready to go. If you need support, we’d love to help! For more information, visit our FAQ page or get in touch with us at support@compensate.com.

**Features**

- Built-in overcompensation to double the climate impact
- We direct all the compensation funds received towards carbon capture
- Multiple languages for the customer plugin (English, German, French, Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch)
- Multiple currencies (EUR, USD, SEK, DKK, GBP, CAD)
- Info right in the app: Your customers don’t need to abandon their carts to learn more about Compensate

We calculate the climate impact of your customer’s order and shipment when they add items to their cart. In the shopping cart, your customers will see a checkbox enabling carbon negative delivery. If they click 'yes' and choose to compensate, we’ll add a small fee to their order and keep it clear by marking it as a new product in their cart. Other than that, the check out process remains the same.

Once the order is placed, you’ll ship it as you normally would – and we’ll get busy compensating for the climate impact! We don’t take any cuts from your customers’ payments, but use them in full towards carbon capture.

We’ll also let you know the impact achieved: your customer will see it in their receipts, and you’ll see it in your dashboard.

The emission calculations we use are based on the weight of the package and the distance of the delivery. On average, the cost of offsetting an international shipment weighing 1kg is 0.40€. On average, the cost of offsetting a domestic shipment weighing 1kg is 0.05€. Our calculations are verified, and you can read more about the math on our [website](https://www.compensate.com/faq-ecommerce).

**Privacy considerations**
The Compensate for WooCommerce product is created for store owners who use WooCommerce to power their stores. The product provides a service which enables your customers to offset the CO2 emissions generated when shipping their purchases

50 kg > 0,95 €

International delivery (air freight):
0,12 kg (120 g) and less > 0,05 €
0,5 kg > 0,20 €

= How does Compensate use the compensation payments? =

Compensate uses 100% of the received compensation payments to purchase certified carbon credits, meaning we take no cuts from your customers’ payments. We manage a carbon capture portfolio which is always on the lookout for the most sustainable, cost effective and reliable methods. We’re supported by leading climate scientists through our Scientific Advisory Panel.

= What does carbon negativity mean? =

Carbon negativity means that some human action doesn’t add CO2 to the atmosphere, but rather removes it. In technical terms, something qualifies as carbon negative if the total carbon emissions attributable to that action are lower than the total amount of carbon dioxide that is removed as a result of the action.

There’s already too much CO2 in the atmosphere. To fight climate change, we have to reduce our carbon emissions AND remove that excess CO2 from the atmosphere. We know and can do that with carbon capture. We also have a historical responsibility to remove CO2, because the “safe levels” of CO2 (350 ppm) were surpassed in 1987 – this is why going just “carbon neutral” is not enough to solve the climate crisis.
